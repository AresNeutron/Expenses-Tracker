Expenses Tracker
This is a prototype full-stack application that allows users to securely manage and record their financial transactions. 
It provides a clean and intuitive interface, built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS on the frontend, while the backend is implemented using Python and Django REST Framework (DRF).

Categories: Transactions can be categorized (e.g., Food, Rent, Salary, Utilities, Entertainment).
Date Tracking: Each record includes the transaction date.

Backend Overview
